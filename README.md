## Project Ideas 

Anything that you can share with other people and group by some category.

- Hours spent minding the dog. TrainTrack.
  - This app would allow a group of people that are training a dog to record the time spent training/minding her.
  - Possible bonus feature would be pre-made tasks such as "30-minute walk", "20 minutes of playtime" and "15 minutes of relaxation exercises"
  - Names: 
    - TrainTrack

What do you spend time doing in association with other people?
It could be a time management app for a small startup like Late?
A time management application for a group of developers?
